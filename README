NOTE - Please do not touch the targets.json file. gkno relies on it
       for proper resource management. Thanks. :)

 -- Looking for this genome's resource data? --
 ---------------------------------------------- 

From the launcher's root directory, typing:

    ./gkno add-resource

will display a list of all genomes that gkno is hosting and can fetch for you. 
If you see the organism you're looking for, typing:

    ./gkno add-resource <organism>

will download its current genome build, or release. That release's files will be 
stored under the organism's directory: 
(i.e. .../gkno_launcher/resources/homo_sapiens/build_37).
In addition, a symlink (shortcut) named "current" will be created in the 
organism's directory that points to the current release.

Later, in addition to updating gkno itself, typing:

    ./gkno update

will show a list of all organisms with new 'current' releases. Typing:

    ./gkno update-resource <organism>

will fetch its into the organism's directory, and move the "current" symlink to
point to the new release data. You may also add the new release without 
changing the "current" shortcut (see below on adding particular releases). 

Most organisms have named "aliases" that you may use when adding or removing 
resources. For example, typing:

    ./gkno add-resource human
    ./gkno remove-resource mouse
    ./gkno update-resource c.elegans

would have the same effect same as typing:

    ./gkno add-resource homo_sapiens
    ./gkno remove-resource mus_musculus
    ./gkno update-resource caenorhabditis_elegans

but *much* easier to type. :)

 ------------------------------------------------------
 -- Want to add a particular (older) genome release? --
 ------------------------------------------------------

As new genome versions are released, you may find that the most current one is 
not the one you want to work with. If we host an older release, it's easy to 
fetch. From the launcher's root directory, typing:

    ./gkno add-resource <organism> --release

will display a list all available releases for that genome. Once you see the 
release you want, typing (for example):

    ./gkno add-resource human --release build_36.3

will store that release of the genome in a subdirectory called build_36.3 
( .../gkno_launcher/resources/homo_sapiens/build_36.3/ ). 

gkno can handle multiple releases for a particular genome, so feel free to add 
as many or as few releases as you need. Just be sure to specify the correct 
resource path when you run a pipe or tool command.

This approach also works for grabbing a newer release without changing your
organism's "current" symlink. 

 ----------------------------------------
 -- Want to remove an organism's data? --
 ----------------------------------------

From the launcher's root directory, typing:

    ./gkno remove-resource

will display all of your resources (organisms and their releases) that can
be removed. Typing:

    ./gkno remove-resource <organism>

will remove all of the resource data for that organism (all releases).

Removing a particular release is as simple as adding it. Typing (for example):

    ./gkno remove-resource human --release build_36.1

will remove the files for that release only, leaving any others intact.
